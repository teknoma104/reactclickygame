### Overview

Homework to create a memory game with React. The assignment required me to break up my application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

### Features

The React Click Game:

   * Upon page load will shuffle 12 characters out of a roster of 20
   
   * The game will compare if the user has already clicked that character before:
      * If user has clicked the same character twice, the game is over, score is reset to 0 (top score will be updated accordingly)
      * If user keeps clicking different characters each time, each click is worth 1 point and keeps incrementing until the user clicks the same character twice
   

### Technologies/Packages Used

* React and React components

* Bootstrap 4
